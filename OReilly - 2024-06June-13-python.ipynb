    "Back in early days of computing, if you wanted to solve a problem, you built a specific computer to solve it. That was obviously very expensive and very time consuming. In time, people created general-purpose problem-solving computers, which they could modify using *software*, meaning the instructions written in 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news? We saved a lot of time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news? Who wants to program in 1s and 0s?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very quickly, they created \"programming languages\" that we could write in something resembling English, and which would be translated into the 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous ways to do this translation, including such systems as interpreters, compilers, and byte-compilers (which is what Python, Java, and .NET all use). You can imagine that each programming language has its own advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C executes very quickly, but is hard for people to write\n",
    "- Python, by contrast, executes kind of slowly, but it is easy for people to write\n",
    "\n",
    "That's more important today, when we spend most time debugging and maintaining code, not writing it or even executing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to say that Python is a perfect language in an age when computers are cheap and people are expensive.\n",

    "\n",
    "- In edit mode (which I'm in right now), everything you type is put into a cell. You can enter edit mode by pressing ENTER or by clicking inside of a cell. The outline is blue and the background is black.\n",
    "- In command mode, everything you type is a command to Jupyter, controlling the environment -- but what you type won't be entered into the cell. You can enter command mode by pressing ESC or clicking to the left of the cell. You can tell that it's in command mode by a gray-ish background and a white outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command mode lets us do a bunch of things:\n",
    "- `c` -- copy the current cell\n",
    "- `x` -- cut the current cell\n",
    "- `v` -- paste the most recent copy/cut\n",
    "- `a` -- get a new cell above the current one\n",
    "- `b` -- get a new cell below the current one\n",
    "- `y` -- put the current cell into Python coding mode\n",
    "- `m` -- put the current cell into Markdown text-formatting mode (what I'm in right now)\n",
    "- `h` -- get help on what you can type as commands into Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "When I type in edit mode, everything I type is taken literally. When I press shift+ENTER, the cell is \"executed,\" which means that we either see the text formatted (in Markdown) or the Python executed."
